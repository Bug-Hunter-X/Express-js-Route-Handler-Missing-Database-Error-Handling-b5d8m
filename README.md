# Express.js Route Handler Missing Database Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: neglecting error handling within route handlers, specifically when interacting with databases.

The `bug.js` file showcases a route handler that fetches user data. While it correctly handles the case where a user is not found, it lacks error handling for database query failures.  This omission could lead to unhandled exceptions and application crashes.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected implementation, incorporating robust error handling to catch and gracefully manage potential database errors.
